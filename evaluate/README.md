# Evaluation for Network
- All evaluation code are writing using python 3.5.2.   

- The predict_sequences.sh is an example for running the evaluation code.   
If you want to evaluate your own network, please refer to predict_sequences.py, and the configure step is needed for your own mdel/dataset path.  

- We use the errors-computation method as [monodepth](https://githubcom/mrharicot/monodepth/blob/master/utils/evaluation_utils.py).
